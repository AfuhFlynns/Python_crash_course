## Variable

A variable is a **container or store** for storing data in a program. or a Variable is a **label** for data that can be assigned a value.

e.g

```python
name = "Roy"
age = 40
gender = "Male"
genderC = 'M'
tribe = "Batibo"
country = "Cameroon"
```

## Naming a variable

**NB: When naming a variable, follow these rules:**

### _A variable name can_

### 1. Start with an underscore or letter not number

```python
name1 = "John" 
# not 
1name = "John"

#Or
_name = "John"
# not 
1name = "John"
```

### 2. Contain only letters, underscores and numbers (No -, $ etc.)

```python
_name = "AfuhFlynn"
# not allowed
$name = "John"
```

### 3. Not contain white spaces

To avoid this, we use naming conventions (Pascal casing, camel casing, all lower case or underscores to separate words)

```python
my_name = "AfuhFlynn"

# not allowed
my name = "John"
```

### Naming conventions

#### 1. PascalCasing

Here, the first letter of every word in the variable name is capitalized (Not separated by spaces)

e.g

```python
MyName = "John Flynn"
```

#### 2. camelCasing

Here, the first letter of the variable name is always lower case

e.g

```python
myName = "John Flynn"
```

#### 2. all_lower_case

Here, all letters in the in the variable name are lower case. **It is avisiable to use underscores ( _ )** in naming variables to make it more readable

e.g

```python
alllongpigs = 80 # Not quit readable
# The preferred method
all_long_pigs = 80 # More readable.
```

**NB:** This is the most used naming convention in python.
