# String
name = "Afuh Flynn" 
# Or
name = 'Afuh Flynn'

# This flexibility in strings allows us to do:
name = "My name's Afuh Flynn"
name = 'My quote: "My name is Afuh Flynn"'

print(name)

## Changing case with methods
# 1. The title() method. It capitalizes every first letter of words in the string
name = "john dalton"
print(name.title()) # A title has every first letter of every word capitalized

# 2. The upper() method. It changes all the letters to upper case
print(name.upper())

# 3. The lower() method. It changes all the letters to lower case
name = "TEMBENG MYLSE"
print(name.lower())
